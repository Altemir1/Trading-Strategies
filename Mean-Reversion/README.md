# Mean Reversion Trading Strategy

## Overview
The *Mean Reversion Strategy* is based on the assumption that stock price is tend to return to its mean, when it goes from the mean price significantly up or down. Sources states that this strategy is only useful during sideways market, as it's not volatile and don't create huge spikes where startegy is losing money. For the testing of the strategy I use stock of the company called KEGOC. This company works in energy sector and one of the biggest in Kazakhstan. The reason behind selecting this stock, is that prices fluctatues in the same range over last 2 years. Perfect fit fro the strategy at first glance.
